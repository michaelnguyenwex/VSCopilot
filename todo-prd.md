## 2. Functional Requirements (FR)

| Requirement ID | Description                     | User Story                                                                                   | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication** |                                 |                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| FR001          | User Sign Up                    | As a new user, I want to create an account using my email and password.                      | The UI provides fields for email and password, and a "Sign Up" button. On success, a new user is created in Supabase Auth, and the user is typically logged in. Basic email format validation. |
| FR002          | User Login                      | As a registered user, I want to log in using my email and password to access my tasks.         | The UI provides fields for email and password, and a "Login" button. On success, the user's session is established, and they are directed to the task view. Handles incorrect credentials.   |
| FR003          | User Logout                     | As a logged-in user, I want to log out of the application to secure my session.                | A "Logout" button/action is available. Clicking it terminates the user's session (client-side and potentially notifies Supabase) and returns the user to the login/signup view.       |
| FR004          | Session Persistence             | As a logged-in user, I want to remain logged in when I close and reopen the application.       | The application (via the Supabase client library) securely stores session information locally. Upon reopening, the app automatically restores the session if valid, bypassing login.       |
| **Task Management (CRUD)** |                         |                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| FR005          | Add New Task                    | As a logged-in user, I want to add a new task with a title so I can track what I need to do. | An input field and an "Add" button are present. Entering text and clicking "Add" creates a new task record in Supabase associated with the current user (`is_complete=false`) and updates the UI list. |
| FR006          | View Task List                  | As a logged-in user, I want to see a list of all my tasks (pending and completed).           | After login, the application fetches and displays only the tasks belonging to the logged-in user. The list shows the task title and its completion status.                            |
| FR007          | Visual Distinction for Tasks    | As a user viewing my tasks, I want completed tasks to look different from pending tasks.       | Completed tasks in the list are visually distinct (e.g., greyed out, strikethrough text, checked checkbox) compared to pending tasks.                                                   |
| FR008          | Mark Task Complete/Incomplete | As a logged-in user, I want to mark a task as complete/incomplete to track my progress.        | An interactive element (e.g., checkbox) allows toggling the `is_complete` status. The change is persisted to Supabase and reflected immediately in the UI list.                       |
| FR009          | Edit Task Title                 | As a logged-in user, I want to edit the title of an existing task if details change.           | A mechanism (e.g., edit button, inline editing) allows the user to modify the `title` of a task. The change is persisted to Supabase and updated in the UI.                            |
| FR010          | Delete Task                     | As a logged-in user, I want to delete a task that is no longer relevant.                     | A "Delete" button/icon is available for each task. Clicking it (potentially after confirmation) permanently removes the task record from Supabase and the UI list.                    |
| FR011          | Task Ownership                  | As a user, I only want to see and manage the tasks that I created.                           | The application logic and backend security (RLS) ensure that API calls only ever fetch, create, update, or delete tasks associated with the currently authenticated user's ID.          |

## 3. Data Requirements (DR)

| Requirement ID | Description              | User Story                                                                 | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DR001          | Task Data Schema         | N/A (System Requirement)                                                   | A Supabase table (e.g., `todos`) exists with columns: `id` (PK, uuid/bigint), `user_id` (uuid, FK to `auth.users`), `title` (text, not null), `is_complete` (boolean, default false), `created_at` (timestamptz, default now). |
| DR002          | Data Persistence         | As a user, I expect my tasks to be saved even if I close the application.  | All task data (creations, updates, deletions) is saved persistently in the Supabase PostgreSQL database.                                                                                          |
| DR003          | Row Level Security (RLS) | As a user, I expect my task data to be private and inaccessible to others. | RLS is enabled on the `todos` table in Supabase. Policies are configured to restrict SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations based on `auth.uid()` matching the task's `user_id`.                 |

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

| Requirement ID | Description        | User Story                                                                               | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NFR001         | Performance      | As a user, I want the app to load my tasks quickly and respond instantly to my actions.  | Task list loads within ~1-2 seconds. CRUD operations feel responsive (< 500ms). Performance should be acceptable for hundreds of tasks per user.                                                |
| NFR002         | Usability          | As a user, I want the app to be simple and easy to understand without instructions.      | The UI is clean, intuitive, and follows platform conventions (for MAUI/Blazor/WPF etc.). Core actions (add, complete, view) are easily discoverable.                                         |
| NFR003         | Reliability        | As a user, I expect the app to work consistently without crashing or losing data.        | The application is stable under normal use. Data saved via Supabase is reliably retrieved. Basic error handling prevents crashes on common issues (e.g., network errors).                       |
| NFR004         | Security           | As a user, I trust the app to keep my account and task data secure.                      | Authentication handled securely by Supabase Auth. API communication uses secure tokens (handled by Supabase client). RLS prevents unauthorized data access (Covered by DR003).              |
| NFR005         | Maintainability    | N/A (Developer Requirement)                                                              | The C#/.NET code follows standard coding practices, is reasonably organized, and commented where necessary, facilitating future updates and bug fixes.                                         |
| NFR006         | UI Feedback        | As a user, I want to know if the app is working or if something went wrong.              | Visual indicators are shown during loading states (e.g., fetching tasks). Clear success or error messages are displayed for operations like login, signup, task creation/deletion failures. |
